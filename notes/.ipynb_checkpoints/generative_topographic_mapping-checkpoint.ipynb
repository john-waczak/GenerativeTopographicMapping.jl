    "*Goal*: We want models that can find interesting structures in un-structured data without the need for human labeling or intervention. The key feature of many such methods is that they perform **Dimensionality reduction**. Data in some high dimensional feature space are *assumed* to truly be living on a lower dimensional submanifold of the higher dimensional space. If the goal is to visualize interesting structures in the data, typically, we chose the dimension of the reduced data to be $2$, or $3$.\n",

    "**Generative Topographic Mapping** assumes that our large dimensional dataset $\\mathcal{D}\\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^D$ is actually *generated* by a set of **latent variables** living in $\\mathbb{R}^L$. For visualization, we will typically choose $L=2$, but strictly speaking, we require only that $L<D$. Our goal then is to learn the mapping from latent variables to our data space. \n",
